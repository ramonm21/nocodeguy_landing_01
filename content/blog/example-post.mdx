# Your Blog Post Title

This is your blog post content. You can use all MDX features including:

## Headers
- Bullet points
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*

```javascript
// Code blocks
const example = "Hello World";
```

You can also use React components if you set them up in your MDX configuration.
